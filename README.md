This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and custom setters.  When a custom setter modifies another property that also triggers KVO, it can result in an infinite loop or unexpected behavior. The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from the cascading KVO notifications, a common pitfall when working with KVO and complex object relationships. The solution involves carefully managing KVO notifications to prevent the infinite loop.
